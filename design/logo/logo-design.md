# Logo Design

The logo design for Michishirube follows a modern minimalist style. It features:

- A square icon with rounded corners, similar to macOS icons
- A solid white background
- A simple, modern kanji character in the center, using a clean and minimalist font
- The kanji character in a bold blue color
- No additional borders or gradients, keeping the design clean and minimal

You can find the logo samples in the `assets` directory.
